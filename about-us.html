That is why bottled air companies air on the rise and seem to be popping up everywhere. The options might seem immense and overwhelming, but there is a clear winner among them and that is Sky Vial. This company has been packaging air since the 1950’s for scientific studies, but now they have branched into the commercial world offering a variety of options for bottled air enthusiasts. They specialize in their trusted and proven method of sealing in the elements that make air feel crisp and refreshing without any chemical or processed scent. They pride themselves in sourcing only from the finest airs such as Himalayan Mountain range. Their patented technology allows them to store the air and store it for a long time. How long? Well one of their best-selling products is 15-year-aged-air that proven to have a more concentrated and even cleaner flavor. Their previous endeavor in scientific research allowed them to explore preservation technology that rivals any competitor   in the market. Their containers have been rated as 10/10 by the National Bottled Air association for 10 years in a row. The technology behind their product as well the quality of their source has put them on the top of the bottled air market. They aren’t stagnating too; they just launched their new triple oxidized 02 which promises even cleaner air with more volume being fit into their iconic container. With the launch of their new product, they also have launched their new site which now simplifies ordering their product and subscribing to their refill plans. So which product should you start with? The previously mentioned aged Himalayan air is great beginner choice, but also consider their best seller which is the mint flavored O2 which further enhances the refreshing hit of their bottled air.
