# seo-website-project

Website created by [zachpaul77](https://github.com/zachpaul77) and [jkenjidc](https://github.com/jkenjidc) which markets fictional 'bottled air' products.

The goal of this project is to implement what was learned in our web development class. This includes site design, search engine optimization, and cloud server hosting (Amazon ec2).
